Codebook: Getting and cleaning assignment

This files will give the detail about the variables and data I have used in code to clean data.

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Here are the data for the project:

The data given is composed of:
         Activity ( e.g. Running / Walking )
         Subject ID ( from 1:30 )
         Time Window of Reading ( from 1:128 )
         Partition  ( test / training )
         Axis ( x / y / z )
         Gyro Angular Velocity ( mearsurement from file )
         Accelerometer Total Acceleration ( measurement from file )
         Body Acceleration Estimate ( calculation as found in file )
         Gravity Estimate ( calculation of Total - Body acceleration derived from above two datapoints)

Later,the set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation

So the below features are used:
